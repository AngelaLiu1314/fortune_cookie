# Fortune Cookie Generator

## Purpose:
This project is a fortune cookie generator that aims to give you a little extra luck throughout your day. I'm not superstitious, however, when going through a stressful part of my life, I find it comforting to have a small piece of advice to guide my day. This app allows users to experience opening a fortune cookie without having to go out and buy them.

## Instructions:
1. Clone the respository
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project's directory
3. npm start to activate the app
4. Click on the cookie to generate your fortune!

## API:
The API I chose for this project was developed by Elitezen and accessed through their github https://github.com/Elitezen/fortunecookies. There are no API keys or authentification tokens needed to set up this API. I used this API to generate the random fortune and 6 lucky numbers that are displayed on my app.

## AI Use:
I used ChatGPT in this project to help with the website design and to creat the css file. I gave the following prompts to ChatGPT in order to generate the css file:
- "please center the features of this website and make the button a large fortune cookie to click on"
- "please make the background more interesting with a color gradient from blue to green"
